# Contributing to LA-CoNGA physics

:tada::balloon::cake: **Welcome to _LA-CoNGA Physics_ repository!** :cake::balloon::tada:

:dizzy::hatched_chick::sunny: _We're excited that you're here and want to contribute._ :sunny::hatched_chick::dizzy:

Welcome to LA-CoNGA physics GitHub repository, and thank you for thinking about contributing!

The point of this file is to make it as easy as possible for you to get involved.

We need experts (researchers and teachers) in the Advanced physics for curricula design, in interconnected instrumentation, in data management (particularly ensuring the highest quality data protection plans are in place), in communication, in fundraising, app development, user experience design and documentation.

If you think you can help in any of the areas listed above (and we bet you can) or in any of the many areas that we haven't yet thought of (and here we're sure you can) then please check out our contributing guidelines below for more information on how to get started.

Please note that it's very important to us that we maintain a positive, open, safe and supportive learning environment for everyone who wants to participate. When you join us we ask that you follow [our code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) in all interactions both on and offline.

If you have any questions that aren't discussed below, please let us know through one of the many ways to [get in touch](#get-in-touch).

## Joining the community

_LA-CoNGA Physics_ is an [Erasmus+ Capacity Building](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/erasmus-plus/opportunities/organisations/innovation-good-practices/capacity-building-higher-education_en) project, an European-Latinamerican network which aims to support the modernization of the university infrastructure and the pedagogical offer in advanced physics in four Latin American countries. We, therefore, require that all our members and their contributions **adhere to our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) (CoC)**. Please familiarize yourself with our [CoC](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) that lists the expected behaviours.

## Inclusivity

_LA-CoNGA Physics_ aims to be inclusive to people **from all walks of life and to all research fields.**
These intentions must be reflected in the contributions that we make to the project.

In addition to the CoC, behavior in each LA-CoNGA scenario must respect diversity and promote equity and inclusion, as mentioned in our **[Diversity Plan](diversity_plan.md)**.

We encourage intentional, inclusive actions from contributors to _LA-CoNGA Physics_. Here are a few examples of such actions:

- Use respectful, gender-neutral and inclusive language (learn more about [inclusive writing](https://www.le.ac.uk/oerresources/ssds/studyskills/page_37.htm), resource by University of Leicester).
- Aim to include perspectives of researchers from different research backgrounds such as science, humanities and social sciences by not limiting the scope to only scientific domains.
- Make sure that the colour palettes are accessible to colour-blind readers and contributors.
See the blogpost [Designing Scientific Figures for Colour Blindness](https://www.lewismackenzie.science/blog-1/2017/2/9/designing-scientific-figures-for-colour-blindness) for an example of how somebody improved one of their diagrams, including links to recommended colour palettes and a colour-blindness simulator.

## Where to start :point_right: LA-CoNGA Platform

We have a set of tools to facilitate the activities developed in LA-CoNGA Physics. These tools seek to manage aspects such as communication, online classes, content preservation or computational calculation in the best way. In [LA-CoNGA Tools Docs](docs/laconga_platform.md) you can find more details of LA-CoNGA Physics platform and guides for the use of each of the tools.

## Recognising Contributions

We welcome and recognise all kinds of contributions, from XXXXXX, to XXXXX.
Your contributions will be acknowledged and recorded ...
_LA-CoNGA Physics_ follows the [all-contributors][https://github.com/all-contributors/all-contributors] specifications.
The all-contributors bot usage is described [here](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/bot/usage).
You can see a list of current contributors [here](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/master/contributors.md). üòç

To add yourself or someone else as a contributor, comment on the relevant Issue or Pull Request with the following:

```
@all-contributors please add <username> for <contributions>
```

You can see the [Emoji Key (Contribution Types Reference)](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key) for a list of valid `<contribution>` types and examples of how we've run this command in [this issue](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues/274).
The bot will then create a Pull Request to add the contributor and reply with the pull request details.

**PLEASE NOTE: Only one contributor can be added with the bot at a time!**
Add each contributor in turn, merge the pull request and delete the branch (`all-contributors/add-<username>`) before adding another one.
Otherwise, you can end up with dreaded [merge conflicts][github-mergeconflicts].
Therefore, please check the [open pull requests](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/pulls) first to make sure there aren't any open requests from the bot before adding another.

What happens if you accidentally run the bot before the previous run was merged and you got those pesky merge conflicts?
(Don't feel bad, we have all done it! üôà)
Simply close the pull request and delete the branch (`all-contributors/add-<username>`).

Finally, don't forget to add yourself to the list of contributors [here](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/master/contributors.md)!
