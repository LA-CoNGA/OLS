# JupyterHUB Computing Service

The JupyterHUB service is a multi-user interactive computing web service. This service offers computational capabilities from a browser to the LA-CoNGA Physics community. Through Jupyter Notebooks users can interactively, execute code in various programming languages and document the process simultaneously. Currently the service has support to programming with _Python_, _R_ and _pyRoot_.

The official documentation for the use of Jupyter Notebooks can be found at [The Jupyter Notebook Docs](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebook.html#)
