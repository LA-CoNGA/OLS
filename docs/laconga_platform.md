## Writing in Markdown

Most of the writing that you'll do in most of the services of the _LA-CoNGA Physics_ platform will be in [Markdown][markdown].
You can think of Markdown as a few little symbols around your text that will allow GitHub to render the text with a little bit of formatting.
For example, you could write words as **bold** (`**bold**`), or in _italics_ (`_italics_`), or as a [link][rick-roll] (`[link](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ)`) to another webpage.

For a detailed guide on how to write in markdown visit the [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) by [Adam Pritchard](https://github.com/adam-p).

[_The Turing Way_ style guide](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/style.html) will provide guidance and supporting resources for ensuring consistency, readability and accessibility for all our users.
