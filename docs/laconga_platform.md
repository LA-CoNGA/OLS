# LA-CoNGA Physics Platform

_LA-CoNGA Physics_ activities are supported and/or developed through a set of tools which form the _LA-CoNGA Physics_ platform. The services supported by the platform are listed below.

- [_Mattermost_ Communication Service](#mattermost-communication-service)
- [_GitLab_ Service](#gitlab-service)
- [_JupyterHUB_ Computing Service](#jupyterhub-computing-service)
- [LA-CoNGA Physics _LCMS_ service](#la-conga-physics-lcms-service)
- [LA-CoNGA Physics _website_](#la-conga-physics-website)
- [_Templates_ LA-CoNGA](#templates-la-conga)

## _Mattermost_ Communication Service

LA-CoNGA Physics internal communications are made with the [_Mattermost_]() communications service. This is a messaging service focused on communication management for workgroups. A service of this type makes it possible to organize communications in a collaborative work environment.

LA-CoNGA Physcis has two workspaces in this service which are listed below.

- [LA-CoNGA](https://mattermost.redclara.net/la-conga)for the coordination of LA-CoNGA Physics.
- [LA-CoNGA-Edu](https://mattermost.redclara.net/la-conga-edu)for the student community.

Below you will find a video tutorial for the use of this service.

A detailed guide for its use can be consulted at [Mattermost Userâ€™s Guide](https://docs.mattermost.com/guides/user.html).

## GitLab service

The Gitlab service is a [Git-based](https://git-scm.com/) collaborative software development and version control web tool. In the context of _LA-CoNGA Physics_ is one of the fundamental tools, it manages from the web service with the contents of the classes, to the tasks performed by the students. The service is available at [https://gitmilab.redclara.net/](https://gitmilab.redclara.net/) and uses the [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) software.

A detailed guide to using the Gitlab service can be found at [Get started with GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/intro/). Regarding the use of git, the book _Pro Git_ written by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub and published by Apress is an excellent guide and can be consulted for free at [https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)

## JupyterHUB Computing Service

The JupyterHUB service is a multi-user interactive computing web service. This service offers computational capabilities from a browser to the LA-CoNGA Physics community. Through Jupyter Notebooks users can interactively, execute code in various programming languages and document the process simultaneously. Currently the service has support to programming with _Python_, _R_ and _pyRoot_.

The official documentation for the use of Jupyter Notebooks can be found at [The Jupyter Notebook Docs](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebook.html#)

## LA-CoNGA Physics LCMS service

The material for the _LA-CoNGA Physics_ module classes is created and preserved by an _LCMS-like_ service (Learning Content Management Service) called _LA_CoNGA Physics Courses_. This service uses the framework [_MkDocs_](https://www.mkdocs.org/) to build a web page. The creation and editing of the educational content for the classes is done collaboratively from the [LA-CoNGA Courses](https://gitmilab.redclara.net/tutoriales/tutorial-mkdocs) repository and hosted in the [GitLab service](gitmilab.redclara.net/). The resulting web page can be viewed in [laconga.redclara.net/courses/](laconga.redclara.net/courses/)

Below you will find a video tutorial for the use of this service.

## LA-CoNGA Physics website

The official website of _LA-CoNGA Physics_ is built with the Wordpress content management system and is available on [https://laconga.redclara.net/](https://laconga.redclara.net/). On this website you will find the description of the inter-institutional alliance called _LA-CoNGA Physics_.
