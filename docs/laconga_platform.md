# LA-CoNGA Physics Platform

_LA-CoNGA Physics_ activities are supported and/or developed through a set of tools which form the _LA-CoNGA Physics_ platform. The services supported by the platform are listed below. In each of the following links the functionalities of the service are described and guides are given for their use.

- [Communication Service _Mattermost _] (mattermost.md) available at https://mattermost.redclara.net
- [Version Control Service _GitLab _] (gitmilab.md) available at https://gitmilab.redclara.net
- [JupyterHUB Computing Service] (jupyterhub.md) available at https://jupyter.redclara.net
- [Educational content management service] (laconga_courses.md) available at https://laconga.redclara.net/courses
- [LA-CoNGA Physics website] (laconga_web.md) available at https://laconga.redclara.net

In general, it is important for anyone within _LA-CoNGA Physics_ to know the markup language _Markdown_. This language is used for writing content in most of the services of the _LA-CoNGA Physics_ platform. Its use is especially important for contributions to the educational content management service, where the classes of the _LA-CoNGA Physics_ teaching modules are documented. A detailed guide for writing in _Mardown_ can be found in the [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) by [Adam Pritchard](https://github.com/adam-p)
