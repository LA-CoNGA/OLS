# GitLab service

The Gitlab service is a [Git-based](https://git-scm.com/) collaborative software development and version control web tool. In the context of _LA-CoNGA Physics_ is one of the fundamental tools, it manages from the web service with the contents of the classes, to the tasks performed by the students. The service is available at [https://gitmilab.redclara.net/](https://gitmilab.redclara.net/) and uses the [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) software.

A detailed guide to using the Gitlab service can be found at [Get started with GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/intro/). Regarding the use of git, the book _Pro Git_ written by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub and published by Apress is an excellent guide and can be consulted for free at [https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)
