# LA-CoNGA Physics LCMS service

The material for the _LA-CoNGA Physics_ module classes is created and preserved by an _LCMS-like_ service (Learning Content Management Service) called _LA_CoNGA Physics Courses_. This service uses the framework [_MkDocs_](https://www.mkdocs.org/) to build a web page. The creation and editing of the educational content for the classes is done collaboratively from the [LA-CoNGA Courses](https://gitmilab.redclara.net/tutoriales/tutorial-mkdocs) repository and hosted in the [GitLab service](gitmilab.redclara.net/). The resulting web page can be viewed in [laconga.redclara.net/courses/](laconga.redclara.net/courses/)
