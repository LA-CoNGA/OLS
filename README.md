# LA-CoNGA physics (Latin American alliance for Capacity buildNG in Advanced physics)

**_This README.md file in also available in Spanish ([README-Spanish]())_**

_LA-CoNGA Physics_ is an [Erasmus+ Capacity Building](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/erasmus-plus/opportunities/organisations/innovation-good-practices/capacity-building-higher-education_en) project, an European-Latinamerican network which aims to support the modernization of the university infrastructure and the pedagogical offer in advanced physics in four Latin American countries: Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela. This virtual teaching and research network is composed of 3 partner universities in Europe and 8 in Latin America, high-level scientific partners (CEA, CERN, CNRS, DESY, ICTP), and several academic and industrial partners (including redCLARA, CAEN, among others). The project is co-funded by the Education, Audiovisual and Culture Executive Agency (EACEA) of the European Commission.

In practice LA-CoNGA has created a set of postgraduate courses in Advanced Physics (high energy physics and complex systems) that are common and inter-institutional, supported by the installation of interconnected instrumentation laboratories and an open e-learning platform. This program is inserted as a specialization in the Physics masters of the 8 Latinamerican partners in Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela. It is based on three pillars: courses in physics theory/phenomenology, data science and instrumentation.

### About the project

### LA-CoNGA physics mission and vision

LA-CoNGA physics mission is the creation of a Latin-American-European Virtual Research and Learning Community in the field of Advanced Physics to promote the values of collaboration, open education and open research in institutes from Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela. We will train a new generation of scientists in Latin-America through a one-year master level specialization program that focuses on three pillars of knowledge: theoretical physics, instrumentation in experimental design and data science. We will build a diverse collaborative network that allows the students to access tools, equipment, and know-how that would otherwise not be available.
