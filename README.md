# Our LA-CoNGA mission

LA-CoNGA physics mission is the creation of a Latin-American-European Virtual Research and Learning Community in the field of Advanced Physics to promote the values of collaboration, open education and open research in institutes from Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela. We will train a new generation of scientists in Latin-America through a one-year master level specialization program that focuses on three pillars of knowledge: theoretical physics, instrumentation in experimental design and data science. We will build a diverse collaborative network that allows the students to access tools, equipment, and know-how that would otherwise not be available.
